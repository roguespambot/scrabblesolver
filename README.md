This app displays the points a user-inputted string is worth in the game of Scrabble. If the user attempts to put in a string with invalid characters, such as numerals or punctuation marks, it will return a message informing them that their input is invalid. 

As a learning project, this app demonstrates that I understand how to:
* write basic HTML 
* use CSS styling
* Use JQuery to handle user input
* Use objects in Javascript
* Write a simple Javascript function

This app was written in Javascript and tested with Mocha.
